Lostech Root Box is a set of Batch scripts licensed under the GPL v2

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0

for installing root access, SuperUser and a more actual BusyBox on Android devices mainly
intended for TechniSat branded devices.

Additionally the AndroidInfo tool for gaining information about devices which might
be also compatible for the same root procedure is also available within the Tool Box.
For the sourcecode of AndroidInfo have a look to my other repository:
https://github.com/Lostech/AndroidInfo

Lostech Root Box itself is only in german language since the TechniSat devices are mainly
sold in Germany. Since the batch scripts can easily be edited and are licensed under GPL v2
feel free to translate them if needed.
