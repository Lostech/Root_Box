Lostech Root Box is a set of Batch scripts licensed under the GPL v2

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0

for installing root access, SuperUser and a more actual BusyBox on Android devices mainly
intended for TechniSat branded devices. Since those are Rockchip RK30 based the root
methods may work for other devices. Therefore an automatic root script for unknown
Rockchip RK30 based devices is also included.

Additionally the AndroidInfo tool for gaining information about devices which might
be also compatible for the same root procedure is also included within the Root Box.
For the sourcecode of AndroidInfo have a look to my other repository:
https://github.com/Lostech/AndroidInfo

Lostech Root Box offers also tools like ADB shell or APK backup.

If you successfully rooted a device which is not officially supported by my Root Box
then please send my the information text file from your device which you can create with
AndroidInfo found in the Tools section of the Root Box. Thanks in advance.

Lostech Root Box itself is only in german language since the TechniSat devices are mainly
sold in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Since the batch scripts can easily be edited and
are licensed under GPL v2 feel free to translate them if needed.
